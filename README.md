# OInspector:  OpenID Connect/OAuth2 Inspector for Fiddler4

OInspector is a simple Fiddler4 inspector extension meant to facilitate analysis and troubleshooting of Fiddler traces representing OpenId Connect and/or OAuth2 network exchanges.
OInspector highlights request parameters and reveal claim values from JWT tokens, making it easier to visually inspect messages and spot anomalies.

OInspector comes "as is", with no guarantees. 

## System Requirements

OInspector requires [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler) for .NET4 (Fiddler4). It will NOT work on Fiddler2. 
You can verify what version you have by clicking on Help->About Fiddler.
